•	Implemented a multi-algorithm facial recognition system using feature-level, score-level and decision-level fusion.
•	Three facial recognition algorithms (Principal Component Analysis, Correlation Matching, Local Binary Pattern) were used as different sources of biometric data and fused at the three fusion levels.
•	Each individual algorithm as well as the multi-algorithm system at various fusion levels was studied and the performance was evaluated and compared. Many of the algorithm combinations achieved 95% accuracy or more for rank 5 in CMC curves.
